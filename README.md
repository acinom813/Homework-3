# Homework-3

In this assignment, Javascript was used to create a password generator. The responsive interface offers a series of prompts that allows the user to select certain elements that generates a password that has random numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and symbols. This task combined most of the building blocks of Javascript to include functions, variables, arrays, conditional statements, and loops.
